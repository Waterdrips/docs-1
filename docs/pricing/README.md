## Why PRO?

Inlets PRO is a commercial-grade Cloud Native Tunnel which is secure by default through automatic TLS (encryption).

* Tunnel through NAT and firewalls transparently
* Automatic link-level encryption for any TCP protocol
* You can either expose a TCP service on the internet, or only to a remote local network 
* Work with any HTTP or TCP traffic - including databases, TLS, SSH, Kubernetes IngressControllers and custom APIs
* You can run in any region where you have access to a server, unlike SaaS products
* You are in complete control of the tunnel at both ends
* We have spent weeks building deep integrations into Kubernetes
* Multi-arch support is built-in for Windows, Linux and MacOS whether on Intel or ARM
* Convenient static binaries are supplied which require no other dependencies
* Free systemd unit files and Kubernetes YAML files and generation of config files
* Free access to dozens of tutorials and complementary OSS projects

You're gaining months worth of work to integrate directly to different cloud vendors and IaaS platforms, if you should need it such as: EC2, Azure, Packet, Scaleway, DigitalOcean and Civo. Terraform can also be used to automate inlets PRO.

Commercial users can rest assured that they have someone to talk to if things are not going to plan. For personal use, users can enjoy free community support.
